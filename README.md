# gm-ebus
Experimental state management solution. 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mariangibala/gm-ebus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mariangibala/gm-ebus)

## Why?

Trying to connect good parts of Flux and MVC. Contrary to pure Flux implementations, store setters are acceptable here for data manipulation within store context. Actions are used for network requests and when event is handled by multiple stores.
